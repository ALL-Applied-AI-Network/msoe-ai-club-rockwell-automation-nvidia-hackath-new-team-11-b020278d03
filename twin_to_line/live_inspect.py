"""Live runtime: camera frames -> event gating (arm clear, scene stable) -> 30 position crops -> inspector ->
fill-sequence state (LIVE_FILL, D021) -> predictions CSV + trial log + operator overlay. Reads image files only (R10).

    python live_inspect.py --source replay:DIR [--labels labels/dev_labels.csv] [--out DIR]
    python live_inspect.py --source folder:DIR [--poll 0.25] [--idle-exit S]
    python live_inspect.py --source stream:URL|DEVICE|FILE [--every 1.0] [--idle-exit S]
        [--inspector rule|resnet] [--threshold d038|preregistered] [--model-dir DIR] [--device mps|cpu]
    python live_inspect.py --export-replay 1 --out results/live/replay_run1 [--from video|stills] [--step 1.0]
    python live_inspect.py --preflight PKG/preflight --out DIR      (GB10 package self-check, LIVE_RUNBOOK.md section 7)

Sources (one code path after decoding: Session.process_frame):
  replay:DIR  every image in DIR in frame-time order, as fast as it runs
  folder:DIR  watches DIR; a new image is decoded only when unchanged during its read and its end marker
              (JPEG FFD9 / PNG IEND) is present. Incomplete versions are logged unreadable after 3 s. Images already in DIR at
              start are ignored (the camera folder still holds the staged test images); session.json counts them.
              A file written again under the same name (a camera overwriting one file) is read again
  stream:SRC  an RTSP / HTTP URL via FFmpeg with bounded open/read calls, or a video file. A live source is read
              continuously and its newest frame is passed on every --every s (default 1.0); drops reconnect and a
              10 s watchdog detects stalls. Unbounded backends/devices require folder/stills fallback.
              A video file gives one frame per --every s of its own
              timestamps (real_data.iter_video: the same frames as --export-replay), as fast as it decodes
Frame time: folder sessions prefer increasing filename time, otherwise elapsed arrival time on the same clock;
replay uses a video frame id
(cap_seal_video_1.mp4@t0612.0.png) or a CSI still name
(cap_seal_20260922_192843_993721.jpg); otherwise the file's modification time.
Frame size (the 'path' column of the trial log):
  640x480    the DEV cap_seal grid: processed as is ('640')
  1920x1080  warped into the DEV 640x480 grid with the frozen transform frame_warp_1080.json (frame_warp.py,
             INTER_AREA), then the same 640 path ('1080->640'): position_map_G.json + DEV offset, event gate, rule
             thresholds and crops are all unchanged. session.json records the transform file's sha256
  any other  wrong_size, nothing processed
Gating (--gate):
  events (default)  events.py's rule, online: arm-clear frames with no position changing by >= CHANGE_T form a
                    segment; one that lasts >= STABLE_S and differs from the previous event is an event, and its
                    FIRST frame is scored (the same frames as events.segment_events, so frame ids join DEV labels)
  each              every arm-clear frame is its own event (staged stills: one image per setup)
Frames with the arm over the fixture are never scored. Fill state from occupancy (LIVE_FILL default), or
fill_state.SequenceTracker with --track (persist 1: each event is already a stable segment).
Outputs in --out (default results/live/<UTC time>):
  predictions.csv     one row per position per event (inspect_frame.py schema; eval_metrics.py reads it)
  trial_log.csv       one row per input frame, every attempt: status, event, per-position state + score, expected
                      state (--labels), latency, notes; an empty 'intervention' column for the operator
  console             operator view: per event, the 30 holes in the camera layout (G26 ... G01 across the top row)
                      with a short state each, then the counts
  overlay_latest.png  the latest event's overlay (30 coloured boxes + legend), replaced atomically (temp + rename);
                      overlays/eNN_<frame>.png; view.html reloads overlay_latest.png every second over file://
  session.json        configuration, code / thresholds / map hashes, counts
Data rule (D011): a frame that is in the dataset index but not in DEV runs 1-3 is refused, so runs 4-5 are never
processed; images from outside the dataset (staged / live captures) are accepted.
Inspectors (--inspector):
  rule (default)  rule baseline; rule_thresholds.json was fitted on DEV draft labels (a placeholder, not a scored arm)
  resnet          synthetic-only ResNet-18 v1 (resnet_inspector.py), threshold D038 (default) or the pre-registered one.
                  G3 on DEV runs 1-3 was NO-GO (87.7 % false positives at D038), so per the plan the rule baseline
                  runs live and the ResNet is scored offline as arm A; the step-9 choice is Noor's.
Preflight (--preflight): prints OS, CPU, glibc, Python, numpy / OpenCV versions and the sha256 of every runtime file,
then scores the package's bundled frames (the 1080 still, 10 DEV run-1 event frames at 640 and as 1080 copies) with
--gate each and compares every hole with the Mac's predictions shipped next to them. Exit 0 = PREFLIGHT OK.
